# Doctober

## Introduction

Doctober is a Hugo module to help empower developers looking to write
documentation, tutorials, and how-to articles on the web.

Examples of the Doctober theme can be found on the following websites

* <https://helpful.wiki>

* <https://zsh.fyi>

## Usage

Please follow the documentation posted on the
official Hugo website if you're unfamiliar with how to 
[use Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/)
in your own projects.

If you're more of the copy-paste variety (guilty of this myself from time to time),
simply add the following code snippet to your Hugo project's `config.toml`

```
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/austintraver/doctober"
    ignoreConfig = false
```
